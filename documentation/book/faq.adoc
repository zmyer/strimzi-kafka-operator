== Cluster Operator

=== Why do I need cluster admin privileges to install {ProductName}?

To install {ProductName}, you must have the ability to create Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
CRDs instruct {ProductPlatformName} about resources that are specific to {ProductName}, such as Kafka, KafkaConnect, and so on.
Because CRDs are a cluster-scoped resource rather than being scoped to a particular {PlatformProductName} namespace, they typically require cluster admin privileges to install.

In addition, you must also have the ability to create ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings. Like CRDs, these are cluster-scoped resources that typically require cluster admin privileges.

The cluster administrator can inspect all the resources being installed (in the `/install/` directory) to assure themselves that the `ClusterRoles` do not grant unnecessary privileges. For more information about why the Cluster Operator installation resources grant the ability to create `ClusterRoleBindings` see the following question.

After installation, the Cluster Operator will run as a regular `Deployment`; any non-admin user with privileges to access the `Deployment` can configure it.

By default, normal users will not have the privileges necessary to manipulate the custom resources, such as `Kafka`, `KafkaConnect` and so on, which the Cluster Operator deals with.
These privileges can be granted using normal RBAC resources by the cluster administrator. See xref:assembly-getting-started-strimzi-admin-str[this procedure] for more details of how to do this.


=== Why does the Cluster Operator require the ability to create `ClusterRoleBindings`? Is that not a security risk?

{PlatformProductName} has built-in link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#privilege-escalation-prevention-and-bootstrapping[privilege escalation prevention^]. 
That means that the Cluster Operator cannot grant privileges it does not have itself. 
Which in turn means that the Cluster Operator needs to have the privileges necessary for _all_ the components it orchestrates.

In the context of this question there are two places where the Cluster Operator needs to create bindings to `ClusterRoleBindings` to `ServiceAccounts`:

. The Topic Operator and User Operator need to be able to manipulate `KafkaTopics` and `KafkaUsers`, respectively.
The Cluster Operator therefore needs to be able to grant them this access, which it does by creating a `Role` and `RoleBinding`.
For this reason the Cluster Operator itself needs to be able to create `Roles` and `RoleBindings` in the namespace that those operators will run in.
However, because of the privilege escalation prevention, the Cluster Operator cannot grant privileges it does not have itself (in particular it cannot grant such privileges in namespace it cannot access).

. When using rack-aware partition assignment, {ProductName} needs to be able to discover the failure domain (for example, the Availability Zone in AWS) of the node on which a broker pod is assigned.
To do this the broker pod needs to be able to get information about the `Node` it is running on.
A `Node` is a cluster-scoped resource, so access to it can only be granted via a `ClusterRoleBinding` (not a namespace-scoped `RoleBinding`). 
Therefore the Cluster Operator needs to be able to create `ClusterRoleBindings`.
But again, because of privilege escalation prevention, the Cluster Operator cannot grant privileges it does not have itself (so it cannot, for example, create a `ClusterRoleBinding` to a `ClusterRole` to grant privileges that the Cluster Operator does not not already have).


=== Why can standard {PlatformProductName} users not create the custom resource (`Kafka`, `KafkaTopic`, and so on)?

Because, when they installed {ProductName}, the {PlatformProductName} cluster administrator did not grant the necessary privileges to standard users.

See xref:normal-user-access-custom-resources-{context}[this FAQ answer] for more details.


=== Log contains warnings about failing to acquire lock

For each cluster, the Cluster Operator always executes only one operation at a time. The Cluster Operator uses locks
to make sure that there are never two parallel operations running for the same cluster. In case an operation requires
more time to complete, other operations will wait until it is completed and the lock is released.

INFO:: Examples of cluster operations are _cluster creation_, _rolling update_, _scale down_ or _scale up_ and so on.

If the wait for the lock takes too long, the operation times out and the following warning message will be printed to
the log:

[source,shell]
----
2018-03-04 17:09:24 WARNING AbstractClusterOperations:290 - Failed to acquire lock for kafka cluster lock::kafka::myproject::my-cluster
----

Depending on the exact configuration of `STRIMZI_FULL_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MS` and `STRIMZI_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`, this
warning message may appear regularly without indicating any problems. The operations which time out will be picked up by
the next periodic reconciliation. It will try to acquire the lock again and execute.

Should this message appear periodically even in situations when there should be no other operations running for a given
cluster, it might indicate that due to some error the lock was not properly released. In such cases it is recommended to
restart the cluster operator.
