= Extending Kafka Connect with plug-ins

The {ProductName} container images for Kafka Connect include the two built-in file connectors: `FileStreamSourceConnector` and `FileStreamSinkConnector`. You can add your own connectors by using one of the following methods:

* Create a Docker image from the Kafka Connect base image.
* Create a container image using {OpenShiftName} builds and Source-to-Image (S2I).
