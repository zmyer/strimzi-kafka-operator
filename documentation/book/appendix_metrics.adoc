This section describes how to monitor Strimzi Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters using Grafana dashboards.
In order to run the example dashboards you must configure Prometheus server and add the appropriate https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter[Prometheus JMX Exporter] rules to your Kafka cluster resource.

WARNING: The resources referenced in this section serve as a good starting point for setting up monitoring, but they are provided as an example only.
If you require further support on configuration and running Prometheus or Grafana in production then please reach out to their respective communities.

ifdef::InstallationAppendix[]
When adding Prometheus and Grafana servers to an Apache Kafka deployment using `minikube` or `minishift`, the memory available to the virtual machine should be increased (to 4 GB of RAM, for example, instead of the default 2 GB). Information on how to increase the default amount of memory can be found in the following section <<installing_kubernetes_and_openshift_cluster>>.
endif::InstallationAppendix[]

=== Kafka Metrics Configuration

Strimzi uses the https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter[Prometheus JMX Exporter] to export JMX metrics from Kafka and ZooKeeper to a Prometheus HTTP metrics endpoint that is scraped by Prometheus server.
The Grafana dashboard relies on the Kafka and ZooKeeper Prometheus JMX Exporter relabeling rules defined in the example `Kafka` resource configuration in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/kafka/kafka-metrics.yaml[`kafka-metrics.yaml`].
Copy this configuration to your own `Kafka` resource definition, or run this example, in order to use the provided Grafana dashboards.

==== Deploying on {OpenShiftName}

To deploy the example Kafka cluster the following command should be executed:

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/kafka/kafka-metrics.yaml

ifdef::Kubernetes[]
==== Deploying on {KubernetesName}

To deploy the example Kafka cluster the following command should be executed:

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/kafka/kafka-metrics.yaml

endif::Kubernetes[]

=== Prometheus

The provided Prometheus https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/prometheus/kubernetes.yaml[`kubernetes.yaml`] YAML file describes all the resources required by Prometheus in order to effectively monitor a Strimzi Kafka & ZooKeeper cluster.
These resources lack important production configuration to run a healthy and highly available Prometheus server.
They should only be used to demonstrate this Grafana dashboard example.

The following resources are defined:

* A `ClusterRole` that grants permissions to read Prometheus health endpoints of the Kubernetes system, including cAdvisor and kubelet for container metrics.  The Prometheus server configuration uses the Kubernetes service discovery feature in order to discover the pods in the cluster from which it gets metrics.  In order to have this feature working, it is necessary for the service account used for running the Prometheus service pod to have access to the API server to get the pod list.
* A `ServiceAccount` for the Prometheus pods to run under.
* A `ClusterRoleBinding` which binds the aforementioned `ClusterRole` to the `ServiceAccount`.
* A `Deployment` to manage the actual Prometheus server pod.
* A `ConfigMap` to manage the configuration of Prometheus Server.
* A `Service` to provide an easy to reference hostname for other services to connect to Prometheus server (such as Grafana).

==== Deploying on {OpenShiftName}

To deploy all these resources you can run the following.  Note that this file creates a `ClusterRoleBinding` in the `myproject` namespace.  If you're not using this namespace then download the resource file locally and update it.

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
oc login -u system:admin
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/prometheus/kubernetes.yaml

ifdef::Kubernetes[]
==== Deploying on {KubernetesName}

To deploy all these resources you can run the following.  Note that this file creates a `ClusterRoleBinding` in the `myproject` namespace.  If you're not using this namespace then download the resource file locally and update it.

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/prometheus/kubernetes.yaml

endif::Kubernetes[]

=== Grafana

A Grafana server is necessary to get a visualisation of the Prometheus metrics.  The source for the Grafana docker image used can be found in the `./metrics/examples/grafana/grafana-openshift` directory.

==== Deploying on {OpenShiftName}

To deploy Grafana the following commands should be executed:

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/grafana/kubernetes.yaml

ifdef::Kubernetes[]
==== Deploying on {KubernetesName}

To deploy Grafana the following commands should be executed:

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/grafana/kubernetes.yaml

endif::Kubernetes[]

=== Grafana dashboard

As an example, and in order to visualize the exported metrics in Grafana, two sample dashboards are provided https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/grafana/strimzi-kafka.json[`strimzi-kafka.json`] and https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/grafana/strimzi-zookeeper.json[`strimzi-zookeeper.json`].
These dashboards represent a good starting point for key metrics to monitor Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters, but depending on your infrastructure you may need to update or add to them.
Please note that they are not representative of all the metrics available.
No alerting rules are defined.

The Grafana Prometheus data source, and the above dashboards, can be set up in Grafana by following these steps.

NOTE: For accessing the dashboard, you can use the `port-forward` command for forwarding traffic from the Grafana pod to the host. For example, you can access the Grafana UI by running `oc port-forward grafana-1-fbl7s 3000:3000` (or using `kubectl` instead of `oc`) and then pointing a browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

. Access to the Grafana UI using `admin/admin` credentials.  On the following view you can choose to skip resetting the admin password, or set it to a password you desire.

. Click on the "Add data source" button from the Grafana home in order to add Prometheus as data source.
+

. Fill in the information about the Prometheus data source, specifying a name and "Prometheus" as type. In the URL field, the connection string to the Prometheus server (that is, `http://prometheus:9090`) should be specified. After "Add" is clicked, Grafana will test the connection to the data source.

. From the top left menu, click on "Dashboards" and then "Import" to open the "Import Dashboard" window where the provided https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/grafana/strimzi-kafka.json[`strimzi-kafka.json`] and https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/grafana/strimzi-zookeeper.json[`strimzi-zookeeper.json`] files can be imported or their content pasted.
+

. After importing the dashboards, the Grafana dashboard homepage will now list two dashboards for you to choose from.  After your Prometheus server has been collecting metrics for a Strimzi cluster for some time you should see a populated dashboard such as the examples list below.

==== Kafka Dashboard
